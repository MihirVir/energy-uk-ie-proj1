# energy-uk-ie-proj1

Could have used media queries but the task was to make it a mobile view only. If it were to make the desktop view plus a mobile view I would have preferred 
using media queries

## Installation Guide
1. Go to the client folder by typing ```cd client``` command on your project root folder
2. Install all the dependencies by typing ```npm install```
3. To start up your app type ```npm run dev```

Project was tested in Samsung Galaxy s20 ultra and iphones. You will be able to have a desktop view too. But it won't look as good as the mobile view.

To enter into mobile view please refer to this documentation https://www.browserstack.com/guide/view-mobile-version-of-website-on-chrome
